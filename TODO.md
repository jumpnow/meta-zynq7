Outstanding tasks

* Full bootloader from NAND using u-boot SPL. First stage works, but don't know how to tell where to find the second stage.

* Missing driver support to load fpga from linux-stable (okay from u-boot)

* Fully test fpga communications with linux-stable (do we have correct kernel features enabled)
  At this point have only tested that we can load and start firmware, not whether we can communicate with it.
